Cross The Gates

There are arrow signs on the oncoming doors, it is necessary to enter input according to the direction of these signs. If this input is compatible with the sign on the door, the door moves in that direction and the player does not hit the door. If the door is slid to the wrong side, the player will hit the door and the game is over.
